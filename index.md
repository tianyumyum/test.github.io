## Bio

I am currently a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Professor [Xianpei Han](http://www.icip.org.cn/team/hanxianpei/) and Professor [Le Sun](http://www.icip.org.cn/index.php/team/sunle/). 
I got my Bachelor degree under the Supervision of [Jinsong Su](https://cdmc.xmu.edu.cn/info/1010/1054.htm) in June 2018. 
My research interests mainly lie in **Event-Centric** Natural Language Processing, but also include Self-supervised Learning and Natural Language Generation. 
Up to now, I have published several papers in the world top conferences (e.g., ACL, EMNLP, AAAI) and the world top journal (e.g. AIJ).
